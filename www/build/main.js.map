As part of the Product Activation system, a unique HWID number is generated when the operating system is first installed. The HWID identifies the hardware components that the system is utilizing, and this number is communicated to Microsoft. Every 10 days and at every reboot the operating system will generate another HWID number and compare it to the original to make sure that the operating system is still running on the same device. If the two HWID numbers differ too much then the operating system will shut down until Microsoft reactivates the product.The theory behind HWID is to ensure that the operating system is not being used on any device other than the one for which it was purchased and registered. However, problems can arise when users start replacing or adding hardware components -- such as motherboards, sound cards, CD-R drives, Ethernet adapters -- because these will generate new HWIDs, and if there are too many differences from the original installation number the system will register that the operating system has been installed on a different device than the original and subsequently shut itself down. The only way to resolve the issue is to telephone Microsoft and explain the new hardware in order to obtain a new code.\"\n            },{\n              title:\"hybrid encryption\",\n              description:\"A method of encryption that combines two or more encryption schemes and includes a combination of symmetric and asymmetric encryption to take advantage of the strengths of each type of encryption.\"\n            },{\n              title:\"hybrid routing protocol\",\n              description:\"Hybrid Routing, commonly referred to as balanced-hybrid routing, is a combination of distance-vector routing, which works by sharing its knowledge of the entire network with its neighbors and link-state routing which works by having the routers tell every router on the network about its closest neighbors.Hybrid Routing is a third classification of routing algorithm.

Micro-VMs, or microVMs, are used in micro-virtualization to isolate individual computing tasks that work with data originating from unknown sources.With micro-virtualization, the Xen-based microvisor that creates each microVM is able to isolate these computing tasks from other computing tasks, applications and network systems. Because each micro-VM is isolated from other micro-VMs as well as the operating system itself, a micro-VM that becomes infected by malware will be completely destroyed when the micro-VM shuts down, preventing the malware from being able to corrupt other tasks, apps or the system itself.The hardware-isolated micro-VMs stand in contrast to software sandboxing, which can leave the operating system vulnerable to malware. Micro-VMs are restricted to accessing a minimal set of operating system resources and are unable to interact with other system processes, ensuring security while also limiting potential latency and bottleneck issues.\"\n            },{\n              title:\"Microsoft Forefront Endpoint Security\",\n              description:\"Microsoft Forefront Endpoint Security refers to an enterprise-grade line of security products offered by Microsoft in its security software product line.

It allows for deployment of innovative routing and switching protocols in your network for many different applications, including virtual machine mobility and high-security networks.OpenFlow got its start as a research project led by Guido Appenzeller while at Stanford.

For such applications, the SCTP path/session failure detection mechanisms, especially the heartbeat, will actively monitor the connectivity of the session. SCTP offers recognized error-free non-duplicated transfer of messages. Detection of data loss, data corruption and duplication of data is achieved by using checksums and sequence numbers. A selective retransmission mechanism is applied to correct loss or corruption of data.SCTP connections are established after a 4-way handshake between two SCTP endpoints, usually a client and a server. The server, after having received the client��s association setup request, returns an acknowledgement of the setup request containing a data structure called cookie, which is protected by a secure message authentication code, and does not change state. Only when this cookie is returned by the client unchanged does the server allocate resources and establish a new association.With its inception, SCTP was designed to provide a general purpose transport protocol for message-oriented applications.

Loops occur when there are alternate routes between hosts. To establish path redundancy, STP creates a tree that spans all of the switches in an extended network, forcing redundant paths into a standby, or blocked, state. STP allows only one active path at a time between any two network devices (this prevents the loops) but establishes the redundant links as a backup if the initial link should fail. If STP costs change, or if one network segment in the STP becomes unreachable, the spanning tree algorithm reconfigures the spanning tree topology and reestablishes the link by activating the standby path. Without spanning tree in place, it is possible that both connections may be simultaneously live, which could result in an endless loop of traffic on the LAN.\"\n            },{\n            title:\"spear phishing\",\n            description:\"A type of phishing attack that focuses on a single user or department within an organization, addressed from someone within the company in a position of trust and requesting information such as login IDs and passwords.

Not only can it strain the bandwidth limits of the WAN connection, but it can also be expensive because many WAN connections incur fees only when they are transmitting data.
